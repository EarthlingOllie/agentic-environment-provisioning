# 11: Agent overrides that can't remove the safety guarantees

**What to build:** A developer can bring their own agent image or add sidecars (e.g. an egress proxy) with a Compose fragment in the global config, a template, or a set plan. Sandbox merges it over the default agent, then re-applies its own guarantees, and validates a custom image before any container starts (stories 83–87).

**Blocked by:** 02 (templates), 09 (agent container and `sh`)

**Status:** ready-for-agent

- [ ] An `agent` Compose fragment is accepted in config, templates and set plans, with the set plan winning, then template, then config; it is pinned into the set plan like `source`
- [ ] After merging, sandbox re-applies mounts, user, CA mount, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, capability drops and the no-Docker-socket rule; an override that tries to mount the socket or run as root is overridden (verified by inspecting the rendered override)
- [ ] Extra services in the fragment (e.g. a proxy) join the set network
- [ ] `up` checks a custom image has `sh`, `git` and `claude` on PATH and fails before any other container starts if not
- [ ] Docs state egress is unrestricted in the MVP and show a proxy override example

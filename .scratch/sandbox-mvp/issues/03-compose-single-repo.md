# 03: Backing services come up healthy under Compose; `down` stops them

**What to build:** A set whose repo declares a backing service in `.sandbox/compose.yaml` gets that service started as Compose project `sandbox-<set>`, reachable by its short alias on the set's network, and `up` blocks until healthchecks pass. `sandbox SET down` stops containers and removes the network and volumes while keeping worktrees. Single repo only; no deduplication, IPs or hosts yet (stories 33, 37, 44, 54, 97, 100).

**Blocked by:** 01 (walking skeleton)

**Status:** ready-for-agent

- [ ] Compose is driven through its CLI via subprocess (no Docker SDK); unit runs use a fake behind the CLI seam, integration runs use real Docker
- [ ] A per-set override file is rendered into the set directory; the repo's original compose file is passed alongside it so relative paths resolve from the repo
- [ ] Every resource is labelled with the set name so it can later be reconciled
- [ ] `up` runs `compose up -d --wait` and returns only when every service is healthy
- [ ] A repo with `.sandbox/` but no `compose.yaml` still provisions (worktree only)
- [ ] `down` stops containers and removes network and volumes; worktrees are untouched
- [ ] Fixture repo with a `mysql` service used by the integration test

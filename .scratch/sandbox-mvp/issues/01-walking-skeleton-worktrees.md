# 01: Walking skeleton — `sandbox SET up --repos` creates a set with worktrees

**What to build:** The first end-to-end path through the tool, plus the toolchain it sits on. Running `sandbox jira-123 up --repos api web` from a directory holding `./api` and `./web` creates the set directory under the configured sets root, writes its plan (`sandbox.yaml`, pinning each repo's absolute `source` and `base`), and cuts a git worktree per repo on branch `agent/jira-123`. No containers yet. This ticket also establishes the project conventions and the primary test seam every later ticket builds on (spec: Toolchain, Testing Decisions, stories 12–16, 22–25, 27–30, 31, 35, 36, 110, 111).

**Blocked by:** None (can start immediately)

**Status:** ready-for-agent

- [ ] Python 3.12+ project managed by uv; ruff and pyright strict pass locally and are enforced in CI; unit tests run on Linux and macOS, integration tests (real git) on Linux
- [ ] Typer CLI with the `sandbox [SET] <verb>` shape; a set name that collides with a verb is rejected with a clear error
- [ ] Running on Windows fails with a clear "unsupported platform" error
- [ ] Global config at `~/.config/sandbox/config.yaml` (Pydantic v2) with defaults: `ip_pool` 127.42.0.0/16, templates root, sets root, default agent; invalid config fails with field-level errors
- [ ] Plan schema (Pydantic v2) shared by set plans and templates: `repos.<name>.source` absolute, `base` required in a set plan; the set name is the directory name and never appears in the plan; field-level validation errors
- [ ] `--repos NAME...` resolves repos from the current directory; a repo without `.sandbox/` fails before anything is created
- [ ] Each worktree lives in the set directory on `agent/<set>` cut from `base`; `git worktree add` is serialised per source repo so concurrent `up` processes on the same repo don't corrupt `.git`
- [ ] A later `up` for the same set name reuses a surviving `agent/<set>` branch and warns that `base` was ignored
- [ ] `up` never overwrites an existing plan, and refuses when the requested repos differ from the plan on disk
- [ ] Test seam: the CLI invoked in-process with a config pointing every host-state location at a temp dir; fakes for git available for unit runs, real git in integration runs
